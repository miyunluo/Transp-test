## nn_mask

Training a neural network by assigning weight to datapoint.

—test_all_adult.py 

​	Calculate Qii for whole dataset and individual datapoint.

—test_ind_adult.py

​	Generate Qii for individual datapoint. This function is contained in the above file.

* run: python test_all_adult.py sknn

Two mask%.data files are given:

 ./adult/mask50.data and ./adult/mask200.data

This is the weight for each datapoint, in this case, is (1 - Qii for 'Age'). 

mask50.data is generated by a neural network whose iteration time=50.

mask200.data is generated by a neural network whose iteration time=200.

+ The default one is mask50.data. You can change it in the "ml_util.py" by searching mask.

## nn_norm

Training a neural network without assigning weight to datapoint.

—test_all_adult.py 

​	Calculate Qii for whole dataset and individual datapoint.

—test_ind_adult.py

​	Generate Qii for individual datapoint. This function is contained in the above file.

+ run: python test_all_adult.py sknn

## for both

you can change the training **iteration time** and **run time** by change the value of 

+ n_iter
+ RUNS

in  test_all_adult.py 

I set n_iter=20 and RUNS = 2 in the code.
